# How to install and configure the PayPlug module for OroCommerce 6.0

## 1 - Module installation
The installation is exclusively done using the OroCommerce application console.

To start the installation, browse to your project's root folder and update the application's composer.lock.
To do so, install the module using composer with the following command :

```sh
composer require payplug/payplug-orocommerce --prefer-dist --update-no-dev
```

Remove cache directory with this command:

```sh
sudo rm -rf var/cache/prod
```

To complete the installation, execute the following command:

```sh
php bin/console oro:platform:update --force --timeout=0 --skip-translations --skip-download-translations --skip-search-reindexation --env=prod
```

Finally, make sure to properly clean the cache:

```sh
php bin/console cache:clear --env=prod
```

## 2 - Module configuration
Configuring the module is done through 4 steps.

### 2.1 - Create the integration
You have to create an integration to activate the payment method.
Open the System menu on the left or top of your screen (depending on the position of the menu in your back office), then open "Manage Integrations"
